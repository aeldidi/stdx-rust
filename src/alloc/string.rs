/// A UTF-8â€“encoded, growable string.
///
/// `String` is the most common string type. It has ownership over the contents
/// of the string, stored in a heap-allocated buffer (see [Representation](#representation)).
/// It is closely related to its borrowed counterpart, the primitive [`str`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// You can create a `String` from [a literal string][`&str`] with [`String::from`]:
///
/// [`String::from`]: From::from
///
/// ```
/// let hello = String::from("Hello, world!");
/// ```
///
/// You can append a [`char`] to a `String` with the [`push`] method, and
/// append a [`&str`] with the [`push_str`] method:
///
/// ```
/// let mut hello = String::from("Hello, ");
///
/// hello.push('w');
/// hello.push_str("orld!");
/// ```
///
/// [`push`]: String::push
/// [`push_str`]: String::push_str
///
/// If you have a vector of UTF-8 bytes, you can create a `String` from it with
/// the [`from_utf8`] method:
///
/// ```
/// // some bytes, in a vector
/// let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];
///
/// // We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.
/// let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();
///
/// assert_eq!("ðŸ’–", sparkle_heart);
/// ```
///
/// [`from_utf8`]: String::from_utf8
///
/// # UTF-8
///
/// `String`s are always valid UTF-8. If you need a non-UTF-8 string, consider
/// [`OsString`]. It is similar, but without the UTF-8 constraint. Because UTF-8
/// is a variable width encoding, `String`s are typically smaller than an array of
/// the same `char`s:
///
/// ```
/// // `s` is ASCII which represents each `char` as one byte
/// let s = "hello";
/// assert_eq!(s.len(), 5);
///
/// // A `char` array with the same contents would be longer because
/// // every `char` is four bytes
/// let s = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
/// let size: usize = s.into_iter().map(|c| size_of_val(&c)).sum();
/// assert_eq!(size, 20);
///
/// // However, for non-ASCII strings, the difference will be smaller
/// // and sometimes they are the same
/// let s = "ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–";
/// assert_eq!(s.len(), 20);
///
/// let s = ['ðŸ’–', 'ðŸ’–', 'ðŸ’–', 'ðŸ’–', 'ðŸ’–'];
/// let size: usize = s.into_iter().map(|c| size_of_val(&c)).sum();
/// assert_eq!(size, 20);
/// ```
///
/// This raises interesting questions as to how `s[i]` should work.
/// What should `i` be here? Several options include byte indices and
/// `char` indices but, because of UTF-8 encoding, only byte indices
/// would provide constant time indexing. Getting the `i`th `char`, for
/// example, is available using [`chars`]:
///
/// ```
/// let s = "hello";
/// let third_character = s.chars().nth(2);
/// assert_eq!(third_character, Some('l'));
///
/// let s = "ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–";
/// let third_character = s.chars().nth(2);
/// assert_eq!(third_character, Some('ðŸ’–'));
/// ```
///
/// Next, what should `s[i]` return? Because indexing returns a reference
/// to underlying data it could be `&u8`, `&[u8]`, or something else similar.
/// Since we're only providing one index, `&u8` makes the most sense but that
/// might not be what the user expects and can be explicitly achieved with
/// [`as_bytes()`]:
///
/// ```
/// // The first byte is 104 - the byte value of `'h'`
/// let s = "hello";
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], 104);
/// // or
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], b'h');
///
/// // The first byte is 240 which isn't obviously useful
/// let s = "ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–";
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], 240);
/// ```
///
/// Due to these ambiguities/restrictions, indexing with a `usize` is simply
/// forbidden:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// let s = "hello";
///
/// // The following will not compile!
/// println!("The first letter of s is {}", s[0]);
/// ```
///
/// It is more clear, however, how `&s[i..j]` should work (that is,
/// indexing with a range). It should accept byte indices (to be constant-time)
/// and return a `&str` which is UTF-8 encoded. This is also called "string slicing".
/// Note this will panic if the byte indices provided are not character
/// boundaries - see [`is_char_boundary`] for more details. See the implementations
/// for [`SliceIndex<str>`] for more details on string slicing. For a non-panicking
/// version of string slicing, see [`get`].
///
/// [`OsString`]: std::ffi::OsString
/// [`SliceIndex<str>`]: core::slice::SliceIndex
/// [`as_bytes()`]: std::str::as_bytes
/// [`get`]: std::str::get
/// [`is_char_boundary`]: std::str::is_char_boundary
///
/// The [`bytes`] and [`chars`] methods return iterators over the bytes and
/// codepoints of the string, respectively. To iterate over codepoints along
/// with byte indices, use [`char_indices`].
///
/// [`bytes`]: str::bytes
/// [`chars`]: str::chars
/// [`char_indices`]: str::char_indices
///
/// # Deref
///
/// `String` implements <code>[Deref]<Target = [str]></code>, and so inherits all of [`str`]'s
/// methods. In addition, this means that you can pass a `String` to a
/// function which takes a [`&str`] by using an ampersand (`&`):
///
/// ```
/// fn takes_str(s: &str) { }
///
/// let s = String::from("Hello");
///
/// takes_str(&s);
/// ```
///
/// This will create a [`&str`] from the `String` and pass it in. This
/// conversion is very inexpensive, and so generally, functions will accept
/// [`&str`]s as arguments unless they need a `String` for some specific
/// reason.
///
/// In certain cases Rust doesn't have enough information to make this
/// conversion, known as [`Deref`] coercion. In the following example a string
/// slice [`&'a str`][`&str`] implements the trait `TraitExample`, and the function
/// `example_func` takes anything that implements the trait. In this case Rust
/// would need to make two implicit conversions, which Rust doesn't have the
/// means to do. For that reason, the following example will not compile.
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// trait TraitExample {}
///
/// impl<'a> TraitExample for &'a str {}
///
/// fn example_func<A: TraitExample>(example_arg: A) {}
///
/// let example_string = String::from("example_string");
/// example_func(&example_string);
/// ```
///
/// There are two options that would work instead. The first would be to
/// change the line `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(example_string.as_str());`, using the method [`as_str()`]
/// to explicitly extract the string slice containing the string. The second
/// way changes `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(&*example_string);`. In this case we are dereferencing a
/// `String` to a [`str`], then referencing the [`str`] back to
/// [`&str`]. The second way is more idiomatic, however both work to do the
/// conversion explicitly rather than relying on the implicit conversion.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// A `String` is made up of three components: a pointer to some bytes, a
/// length, and a capacity. The pointer points to the internal buffer which `String`
/// uses to store its data. The length is the number of bytes currently stored
/// in the buffer, and the capacity is the size of the buffer in bytes. As such,
/// the length will always be less than or equal to the capacity.
///
/// This buffer is always stored on the heap.
///
/// You can look at these with the [`as_ptr`], [`len`], and [`capacity`]
/// methods:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let story = String::from("Once upon a time...");
///
/// // Prevent automatically dropping the String's data
/// let mut story = mem::ManuallyDrop::new(story);
///
/// let ptr = story.as_mut_ptr();
/// let len = story.len();
/// let capacity = story.capacity();
///
/// // story has nineteen bytes
/// assert_eq!(19, len);
///
/// // We can re-build a String out of ptr, len, and capacity. This is all
/// // unsafe because we are responsible for making sure the components are
/// // valid:
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, capacity) } ;
///
/// assert_eq!(String::from("Once upon a time..."), s);
/// ```
///
/// [`as_ptr`]: str::as_ptr
/// [`len`]: String::len
/// [`capacity`]: String::capacity
///
/// If a `String` has enough capacity, adding elements to it will not
/// re-allocate. For example, consider this program:
///
/// ```
/// let mut s = String::new();
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will output the following:
///
/// ```text
/// 0
/// 8
/// 16
/// 16
/// 32
/// 32
/// ```
///
/// At first, we have no memory allocated at all, but as we append to the
/// string, it increases its capacity appropriately. If we instead use the
/// [`with_capacity`] method to allocate the correct capacity initially:
///
/// ```
/// let mut s = String::with_capacity(25);
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`with_capacity`]: String::with_capacity
///
/// We end up with a different output:
///
/// ```text
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
/// ```
///
/// Here, there's no need to allocate more memory inside the loop.
///
